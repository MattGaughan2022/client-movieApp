## This is the README for the client side of my movie app

### DESCRIPTION

By utilizing an API for pulling from a cloud MongoDB database (atlasDB), this app is to demonstrate the use of React components and various React tools. 

Movies are fetched and laid out in card-format and can be selected for more in-depth information about the focused movie. Movies can be un/favorited by the logged-in user. 

Users can register (POST to database), login, and view a profile page with a few user details listed as well as a card-list of their currently favorited movies. There is also an option to update their profile.

### How to get project running

Run `npm install` to acquire all dependencies from the package.json file. Ensure that versions of dependencies align. With `parcel` functional, run the command `parcel src/index.html` from the terminal of the project repository. No need to download the API files as they are hosted on a server.
